I am Supriti Mulay, passionate about the intersection of technology and healthcare, and I am fortunate to be working as a Research and Development Engineer at the Sudha Gopalakrishnan Brain Centre, focusing on medical image analysis.  My journey to this point has been an interesting one!  After eight years in the IT services industry, I decided to pursue my passion for research and returned to IIT Madras to complete my Master's degree in Electrical engineering where I specialized in medical image segmentation.  I am particularly interested in neuroimage analysis. I am excited to contribute to the development of innovative solutions that can improve patient care.

When I am not immersed in research, I love exploring the world through travel, experimenting with new flavors in the kitchen, and engaging with the diverse tapestry of human personalities.
